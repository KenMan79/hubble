          "description": "Transfer some liquid free balance to another account. `transfer` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver. It will decrease the total issuance of the system by the `TransferFee`. If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result of the transfer, the account will be reaped. The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor. # <weight> - Dependent on arguments but not critical, given proper implementations for input config types. See related functions below. - It contains a limited number of reads and writes internally and no complex computation. Related functions: - `ensure_can_withdraw` is always called internally but has a bounded complexity. - Transferring balances to accounts that did not exist before will cause `T::OnNewAccount::on_new_account` to be called. - Removing enough funds from an account will trigger `T::DustRemoval::on_unbalanced`. - `transfer_keep_alive` works the same way as `transfer`, but has an additional check that the transfer will not kill the origin account. --------------------------------- - Base Weight: 73.64 Âµs, worst case scenario (account created, account removed) - DB Weight: 1 Read and 1 Write to destination account - Origin account is already in memory, so no DB operations for them. # </weight>",
